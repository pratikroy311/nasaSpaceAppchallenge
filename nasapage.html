		<h2>About</h2>
		<p id="p1">
			The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the United States Federal Government 
responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower established NASA in 1958 with a distinctly civilian, rather than military, orientation encouraging 
peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, 
the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958.Since its establishment, most 
US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and 
later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion 
Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the 
Launch Services Program which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.

NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System; advancing heliophysics through the 
efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program; exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with 
advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons; and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, 
through the Great Observatories and associated programs.

In 2018, NASA alongside with other companies including Sensor Coating Systems, Pratt & Whitney, Monitor Coating and UTRC have launched 
the project CAUTION (CoAtings for Ultra High Temperature detectION). This project aims to enhance the temperature range of the 
Thermal History Coating up to 1,500C and beyond. The final goal of this project is improving the safety of jet engines as well as 
increasing efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions

		<h2>Trending Missions</h2>
        <h3>Apollo Program</h3>
		<div class="box1"><img src="img/apollo.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div id="first">
        <P id="p2">
            The U.S public's perception of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated President John F. Kennedy to 
ask the Congress on May 25, 1961, to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which effectively 
launched the Apollo program.

Apollo was one of the most expensive American scientific programs ever. It cost more than $20 billion in 1960s dollars or an estimated $213 
billion in present-day US dollars.(In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost roughly $27.2 billion, accounting for inflation.)It used the 
Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects.The spacecraft was also bigger; 
it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM). The LM was to be left on the 
Moon and only the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth.

The second manned mission, Apollo 8, brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the Moon in December 1968.Shortly before, 
the Soviets had sent an unmanned spacecraft around the Moon.On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing 
were practiced and then finally the Moon landing was made on the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969.


The first person to stand on the Moon was Neil Armstrong, who was followed by Buzz Aldrin, while Michael Collins orbited above. Five subsequent 
Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. Throughout these six Apollo spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon. 
These missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 381.7 kilograms (842 lb) of lunar samples. Topics covered by experiments performed included 
soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismology, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic fields, and solar wind.The Moon landing marked the end of the space race; 
and as a gesture, Armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the Moon.

Apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body.
Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. 
The program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. 
Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts 
from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.

        <h4>X-15 Program</h4>
		<div class="box1"><img src="img/x15.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div id="second">
        <p id="p3">
           The X-15 was an NACA experimental rocket-powered hypersonic research aircraft, developed in conjunction 
with the US Air Force and Navy. The design featured a slender fuselage with fairings along the side containing 
fuel and early computerized control systems.Requests for proposal were issued on December 30, 1954, for the airframe, 
and February 4, 1955, for the rocket engine. The airframe contract was awarded to North American Aviation in November 1955, 
and the XLR30 engine contract was awarded to Reaction Motors in 1956, and three planes were built. 
The X-15 was drop-launched from the wing of one of two NASA Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses, NB52A tail number 52-003, 
and NB52B, tail number 52-008 (known as the Balls 8). Release took place at an altitude of about 45,000 feet (14 km) and 
a speed of about 500 miles per hour (805 km/h).

Twelve pilots were selected for the program from the Air Force, Navy, and NACA (later NASA). A total of 199 flights were made 
between 1959 and 1968, resulting in the official world record for the highest speed ever reached by a manned powered aircraft 
(current as of 2014), and a maximum speed of Mach 6.72, 4,519 miles per hour (7,273 km/h).The altitude record for X-15 was 
354,200 feet (107.96 km).Eight of the pilots were awarded Air Force astronaut wings for flying above 260,000 feet (80 km), 
and two flights by Joseph A. Walker exceeded 100 kilometers (330,000 ft), qualifying as spaceflight according to the 
International Aeronautical Federation. The X-15 program employed mechanical techniques used in the later manned spaceflight programs, 
including reaction control system jets for controlling the orientation of a spacecraft, space suits, and horizon definition for navigation.
The reentry and landing data collected were valuable to NASA for designing the Space Shuttle.

        <h5>Spaceflight Program</h5>
		<div class="box1"><img src="img/sutt.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <div id="third">    
        <p id="p4">
            The Space Shuttle became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, 
four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985. The first to launch, Columbia, did so on April 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the first known 
human space flight.

Its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which was 
bigger than the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643 km (115–400 miles) 
and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400 kg (54,000 lb).Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.

On 20 missions (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, designed in cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for 
independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock.Another famous series of 
missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.

In 1995, Russian-American interaction resumed with the Shuttle–Mir missions (1995–1998). Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, 
this time a full-fledged space station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as two of the biggest partners in the largest 
space station built: the International Space Station (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began 
relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.

The Shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003.While the 1986 loss was mitigated by 
building the Space Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss.NASA's Space Shuttle program 
had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011. The program 
spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space
